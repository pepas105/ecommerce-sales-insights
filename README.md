# ðŸ“Š Retail Sales Insights Dashboard

## Overview

This project explores a real retail sales dataset to uncover key business insights and build an interactive dashboard. The goal is to simulate how a data analyst would approach a real-world task: cleaning data, finding patterns, creating visualizations, and presenting results that help guide business decisions.

## Objectives

* Clean and prepare raw transactional data for analysis.
* Explore sales trends by city, product line, and customer type.
* Build an interactive dashboard to visualize performance metrics.
* Apply simple forecasting models to predict future sales.
* Present findings in a clear, business-oriented way.

## Tools

* **Python:** pandas, numpy, scipy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn
* **Tableau:** for dashboards and visual reports
* **Jupyter Notebook:** for data exploration and documentation
* **GitHub:** for version control and project tracking
